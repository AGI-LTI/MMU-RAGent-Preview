Weâ€™re excited to offer both **monetary prizes** and **academic exposure opportunities** to recognize outstanding submissions to MMU-RAG.



### ðŸ’° Prize Pool

Thanks to the support of Amazon, MMU-RAG offers a **$10,000 prize pool in AWS credits**.
 Prizes will be awarded to top-performing teams across both tracks.

- Final prize breakdown across tracks and leaderboard categories (e.g., open-source vs. mixed systems) will be announced closer to the submission deadline.

- All prize-winning teams will receive AWS credits for further research and development.

  

### ðŸŽ¤ Present at NeurIPS

Top teams will also be invited to **present their systems** during the **MMU-RAG competition session at NeurIPS 2025**.
 This is a unique opportunity to share with the community!

- Share your methodology and insights with the NeurIPS community
- Gain academic visibility and feedback
- Build connections with researchers and practitioners in retrieval-augmented generation and multimodal AI
